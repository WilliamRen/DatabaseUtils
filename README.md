# DatabaseUtils

A really simple ORM for Android that uses reflection to persist classes that extends SqlObject. Any public, non-transient, non-static fields of type int, long, boolean, enum, float, String, or Date be saved to the database. 

# Usage

## Create tables
To use, create the database as normal with [SQLiteOpenHelper](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/database/sqlite/SQLiteOpenHelper.html). You can create the tables for your object with `SqlObject.createTable();` [See this example in my Hacker News repo.](https://github.com/bishopmatthew/HackerNews/blob/master/src/com/airlocksoftware/hackernews/cache/DbHelperSingleton.java)

## Extending SqlObject
You'll want to add a `create(SQLiteDatabase db, yourArgsâ€¦)` to do setup & error checking, and then call `super.createWithId()` or `super.createAndGenerateId()` to save it to the database. `update()`, `read()`, and `delete()` all work like you would expect them to.

[See this example for an example of how to set up your SqlObjects.](https://github.com/bishopmatthew/HackerNews/blob/master/src/com/airlocksoftware/hackernews/model/Story.java)

## Querying
You use the regular db.query() method to get a cursor to the data. Then you can go through each row and use `SqlObject.readFromCursor()` to read them. [Look here for an example of reading rows from the database.](https://github.com/bishopmatthew/HackerNews/blob/master/src/com/airlocksoftware/hackernews/model/Story.java#L140)
